<h1>Summaries for Week 1</h1>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<h3>Knowledge and Media</h3>

<p class="counter">
Knowledge organizations systems are several schemes that organize, manage and retrieve information, like: search engines and library catalogs.
It is about humans’ knowledge and how they organize it. We need to organize this because there is an overload of information. We organize things in general and specific ways. General means bring things together (collections, preservation and archiving, and to support automation. Specific is more like to achieve a given task. 
The things that we organize can be tangible (physical) or intangible (immaterial).

There are four types or organizing:
1. Physical things: books, clothes and people
2. Information about physical things: store inventories, restaurant ratings
3. Digital things: email, pdfs and video files
4. Information about digital things: search engine indexes
 
A resource is anything of value that can support a goal-oriented activity. So everything can be a resource. On the web we deal with URI’s and URL’s.

<h2>Literature</h2>

<h3>Voida et al. 2011</h3>

<p class="counter">
Voida et al. explains that volunteer coordinators at non-profit organizations are dealing with complex data with insufficient information systems. They gained information from a qualitative study of the information management practices of volunteer coordinators.
  
The volunteer coordinators never had a formal training in information systems. Therefore they produced their own homebrew databases. Homebrew databases are a collection of several information management resources. These are namely resources as spreadsheets, email clients, and paper records. The variety of information depends on the job of the volunteer coordinator.
You can’t be sure about a good information system because they work on different spots like schools and food courts. This diversity and fluidity indicates in conditions that systems need to be accessible from several locations. Volunteer coordinators are limited in time, funding and expertise because the most of them work part-time. These are factors to think about which system to use.

Volunteer coordinators use also: personal office applications, paper, and enterprise or custom databases. All coordinators are looking for a system that can do everything. They continually reconfigure their homebrew databases.

The results led to two trajectories for future research. The first one is to design a more human-centered database system. And the second one is to keep developing the standards and interactions between applications.

<h3>Guha et al. 2016</h3>

<p class="counter">
Guha et al. explain the transition from data, which were shown merely in HTML to how structured data nowadays is shown via Schema.org.

The big search engines Bing, Google, Yahoo and later Yandex created Schema.org in 2011. They 
planned to make one big schema with a big range of topics and give the webmasters one vocabulary to work with.

Schema.org owes a lot to the big companies supporting them. They also provide a lot due the design decisions. 
It was designed to make it simple to publish data for the webmasters. 
The following points helped to make the structured data on the web more successful.

Firstly, syntax, Schema.org tried from the beginning to find a balance between making a clear and simple recommendation 
to webmasters versus the pragmatic acceptance of different syntaxes. Secondly is using, polymorphism, if they allow multiple domains and
ranges for relations.Thirdly, entity references, they need to force publishers to use globally unique URIs for schema terms.
Fourthly, incremental complexity, an incremental and pragmatic approach to complexity is needed by gradually extending the schema.
Finally, the clean up, it keeps the vocabulary meaningful. Otherwise you have to delete it, which results in a clean schema.
